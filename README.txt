## How to install

You can simply extract this package to the C drive under C: directory (or an alternative directory). Then MinGW will be in directory  C:\cp411\MinGW, and so on. 

### Configure GNU C/C++ compiler

1. Add C:\cp411\MinGW\bin to user's environment Path variable
2. Add C:\cp411\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin to user's environment Path variable
3. Open a command line console (cmd), type and run command:

Note that if you have other version of MinGW installed on your computer, remove their environment Path variable. 


### Test Eclipse C++ projects

1. Start Eclipse at C:\cp411\eclipse\eclipse.exe with workspace C:\cp411\workspace

2. Test Eclipse C++ by creating a C++ project helleworld: Eclipse  >  File  >  New  >  C++ Project  > type helloworld in project name box, select Project type: Executable > Hello World C++ Project, select Toolchains: MinGW GCC  > Next  >  Next  >  Finish. Compile and and run the helleworld project. Make sure you see the !!!Hello World!!! in the Eclipse console tab. 

3. Import provided opengl_test project. Eclipse: Import  >  Select: General  >  Existing Projects into Workspace  >  Next  >  Select archive file: Browse to the downloaded C:/cp411/examples/opengl_test.zip  Open  >  Finish. Compile/build and run opengl_test, make sure you see the rotation objects of FreeGLUT shapes.

4. Import provided glsl_demo project. Eclipse: Import  >  Select: General  >  Existing Projects into Workspace  >  Next  >  Select archieve file: Browse to C:/cp411/examples/glsl_demo.zip  Open  >  Finish. Compile/build and run glsl_demo, make sure you see a shining teapot.

### Configure Pandoc

Add C:/cp411/pandoc-2.2.3.2 to userâ€™s environment Path variable.

Open a cmd console, type command: where pandoc

It should display:
